If you're the type of student who does the bare minimum and is googling most of their HW (you know who these people are) you'll have a rough time, but if you pay attention and takes notes and do the work/readings it's a pretty easy A.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Machine learning is a DIFFICULT class. I think Avery does a good job at teaching the concepts but be prepared to do self study and maybe cry a bit. Sometimes his projects can be unclear and he takes a long time to grade things. You definitely don't want to miss classes if you can avoid it.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">The projects are hard to follow. You have to ask him to clarify some questions. The project is also worth 30% of your grade. He's a tough grader and the lecture is kind of boring and long. Too much info is being given in a 3hr class that it's hard to absorb all of the info. Doesn't help that he also does not share class recordings.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Even 1 is too high for him. Simply put, stay away from this professor. His class is the most boring one I've ever taken, and his instruction on projects is a disaster. He records the class but doesn't provide you with recordings...</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Avery is a great professor. The exams are conceptual so read the book and pay attention to the lectures. Group projects are made so that you will really learn so make sure you start early. He can come off as rude but he is always willing to help.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Professor Avery is the BEST professor at CSUF. This man knows his sh*t inside and out. He does a GREAT job of explaining concepts. The negative reviews are from those who failed because they didn't put in the work. Avery is a fair grader and will always help you outside of class. I would take him for EVERY class if I could. Best professor ever.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He teaches well! After attending his class, the textbook gets easy to read. He gives real-world knowledge!</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Kenytt is probably the best professor at CSUF. That's not a hard feat to accomplish - especially in the CS department here, but nevertheless i think he is a great teacher. He teaches well, and makes you work for it. It's how I imagined a proper college course would go. I respect him a lot. He can be rude at times but that's just how he is.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He is a knowledgeable professor in the Machine learning field. He teaches stuff in lecture time. You can learn something from his classes. He assigns the projects in detail and with helpful links on somewhere setup things. All your time will be saved to do your project instead of figuring out new software. You need a lot of deep reading.</div>]\n",

All group projects are randomized, you get new members for every project, so good luck if you get someone who doesn't contribute anything.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He doesn't grade anything all semester, so you have no idea if you're even doing projects correctly. He says the class is designed for beginners, but the very first project is literally back-end game development that just feels overwhelming when learning about APIs. Semester long projects with group member rotation, useless lectures.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">All the negative reviews are coming from ppl who are expecting to cheat/google their way through a csdegree. If youre one of those ppl, dont take his class. IF you want to learn a lot about the subject, pay attention and participate in his lecture and discussion!</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He'll spend 2 hours of lecture responding to random questions posted on canvas and then 1 hour talking about concepts for the subject of that given week. He doesn't show you how to code, he just gives you links to documentation and you basically teach yourself the technologies. Projects are a lot of work, you could get unlucky with a bad group.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He does not grade until the end of the semester, until then you have no idea what your grade will be. Only group projects built around one big project, final group was randomized for no reason.  He doesnt teach ANY code during lecture, only office hours (essential for projects).  Lectures are useless, better off learning from youtube. AVOID PLEASE.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Nice guy. Explains concepts very clearly. If you stick with it &amp; work hard you'll be ok, but an A definitely isn't a given. You have to be extremely prepared in order to ace tests. I suggest looking up videos on concepts before lectures to better follow. It's a stressful class for some, but course is pretty fair besides that. Curves final grade</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">If you're going to take him for 483 be prepared to study your ass off, missing one class might set you back a bit. He's a nice guy and knows the subject well but is extremely tough on grading both for projects and exams. If you're eager about the subject he's the right teacher, otherwise I wouldn't bother the stress.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Avery is genuinely one of the best professors at CSUF. If you're the type of student who does the bare minimum and is googling most of their HW (you know who these people are) you'll have a rough time, but if you pay attention and takes notes and do the work/readings it's a pretty easy A.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Machine learning is a DIFFICULT class. I think Avery does a good job at teaching the concepts but be prepared to do self study and maybe cry a bit. Sometimes his projects can be unclear and he takes a long time to grade things. You definitely don't want to miss classes if you can avoid it.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">The projects are hard to follow. You have to ask him to clarify some questions. The project is also worth 30% of your grade. He's a tough grader and the lecture is kind of boring and long. Too much info is being given in a 3hr class that it's hard to absorb all of the info. Doesn't help that he also does not share class recordings.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Even 1 is too high for him. Simply put, stay away from this professor. His class is the most boring one I've ever taken, and his instruction on projects is a disaster. He records the class but doesn't provide you with recordings...</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Avery is a great professor. The exams are conceptual so read the book and pay attention to the lectures. Group projects are made so that you will really learn so make sure you start early. He can come off as rude but he is always willing to help.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Professor Avery is the BEST professor at CSUF. This man knows his sh*t inside and out. He does a GREAT job of explaining concepts. The negative reviews are from those who failed because they didn't put in the work. Avery is a fair grader and will always help you outside of class. I would take him for EVERY class if I could. Best professor ever.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He teaches well! After attending his class, the textbook gets easy to read. He gives real-world knowledge!</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">Kenytt is probably the best professor at CSUF. That's not a hard feat to accomplish - especially in the CS department here, but nevertheless i think he is a great teacher. He teaches well, and makes you work for it. It's how I imagined a proper college course would go. I respect him a lot. He can be rude at times but that's just how he is.</div>, <div class=\"Comments__StyledComments-dzzyvm-0 gRjWel\">He is a knowledgeable professor in the Machine learning field. He teaches stuff in lecture time. You can learn something from his classes. He assigns the projects in detail and with helpful links on somewhere setup things. All your time will be saved to do your project instead of figuring out new software. You need a lot of deep reading.</div>]\n"
